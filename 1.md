# Flexichain

**Flexichain** is a flexible blockchain built for modularity. It provides several useful modules, including:

- Flexichain-Registar (A registering service for a new chain)
- Flexichain (A custom-built chain)
- Lighthouse (Recursive Proofs)
- Smart Contracts (via AilisVM)

It provides dual-ledger security where other blockchains fail.

Consensus can be done via a load of ways, including:

* Proof-of-History (PoH)
* Proof-of-Work (PoW)
* Proof-of-Stake (PoS)
* Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS)
